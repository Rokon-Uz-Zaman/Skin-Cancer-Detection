# Skin-Cancer-Detection
This a Deep Learning project to classify skin cancer into three different classes,["melanoma","nevus","seborrhic keratosis"] 
This project was inspired by Sebastian Thrun and his project on skin cancer classification. It's also worth mentioning that I got this data from Udacity's Deep Learning Nano-degree.
Built using Pytorch.
